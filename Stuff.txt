2. Depth of a Node
3. Diameter of a tree **
4. Lowest common Ancestor
5. Print all leaves

Trie data structure **

6. All nodes at distance k ***
7. Find if a given tree is a subtree of another ***
8. Largest common subtree ***

10 Red black tree ***


RECURSION
1. binary search

2. longest common subsequence -- recursive approach (DP)
3. all paths from top left to bottom right -- robot question..
4. coin change - recursive (DP)

Disjoint set union -- uses tree concept.

HASHING

hash function - choice
collision

Open addressing
Closed addressing - chaining
